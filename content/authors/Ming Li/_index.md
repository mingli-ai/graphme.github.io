I am a "Shuang Long Scholar" Distinguished Professor at the Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Intelligent Education Technology and Application, Zhejiang Normal University, China. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Information Technology from La Trobe University, Australia. Following that, I completed two postdoctoral fellowships: one at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, La Trobe University, Australia, and another at the Department of Information Technology in Education, South China Normal University, China. I have published extensively in top-tier journals and conferences, including IEEE TPAMI, Artificial Intelligence, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TAI, IEEE TBD, IEEE TII, IEEE TITS, IEEE TETCI, Computers & Education, BJET, NeurIPS, ICML, and IJCAI. I am a member of IEEE, the China Computer Federation (CCF), the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI), and an accredited member of the Australian Mathematical Society (AustMS). Additionally, I serve as a regular reviewer for leading journals such as IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TBD, IEEE TETCI, IEEE TAI, IEEE TII, IEEE TNSE, ACM TOIS, ACM TKDD, ACM TWEB, Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, Knowledge-Based Systems, Information Sciences, Expert Systems With Applications, Neurocomputing, etc.

As the leading guest editor, I organized a special issue on “Deep Neural Networks for Graphs: Theory, Models, Algorithms and Applications” in IEEE TNNLS, and a special session on "Recent Advances in Deep Learning for Graphs" in the 8th International Online & Onsite Conference on Machine Learning, Optimization, and Data Science (LOD2022). I am a PC member at top conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, WSDM, ICME, AJCAI, etc, a member of IEEE Task Force on Learning for Structured Data. I am an Associate Editor of Neural Networks, Associate Editor of Applied Intelligence, an Associate Editor of Alexandria Engineering Journal, an Associate Editor of Soft Computing, an Associate Editor of Network: Computation in Neural Systems, an Associate Editor of Neural Processing Letters, an Editorial Board Member of Education and Information Technologies.

**I am seeking highly motivated students to collaborate with me on exciting research areas, including graph neural networks, graph representation learning, hypergraph neural networks, and geometric deep learning.
